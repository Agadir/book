Taming Text, by Grant Ingersoll, Thomas Morton and Drew Farris is designed to teach software engineers the basic concepts of working with text to solve search and Natural Language Processing problems.  The book focuses on teaching using existing open source libraries like Apache Solr, Apache Mahout and Apache OpenNLP to manipulate text.  To learn more, visit http://www.manning.com/ingersoll.

This directory contains the full source code for all the Taming Text examples.
Most of the code is setup to be run via JUnit tests, though they are not
completely automated at this stage of the book.

All instructions are relative to the tamingText-src directory, called TT_HOME from here on out.

Taming Text uses Maven for building and running the code.  To get started, you will
need:

TODO: Make friendly for Windows.
1. JDK 1.6+
2. Maven 3.0 or higher
3. The OpenNLP English models, available at http://maven.tamingtext.com/opennlp-models/models-1.5.  Place them at the same level as the TT_HOME directory
 in a directory named opennlp-models.
  This can be done by using the following commands on UNIX:
  From the TT_HOME directory:
      cd ../
      mkdir opennlp-models
      cd opennlp-models
      wget -nd -np -r http://maven.tamingtext.com/opennlp-models/models-1.5/
      rm index.html*

4. Get WordNet 3.0 and place it at the same level as the OpenNLP models.  From the TT_HOME directory:
      cd ../
      wget -nd -np -m http://maven.tamingtext.com/wordnet/
      rm index.html*
      tar -xf Wordnet-3.0.tar.gz
